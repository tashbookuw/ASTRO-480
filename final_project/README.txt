This is just the code we used to derive conclusions from
the data. I'm not uploading the data to GitHub because it's 
kind of a lot of data. If you want to see it, let me know and
I'll find a better way of getting it to you. 

Margaret and I have somewhat different code. I mean, of course
we based the gist of it on each other's work and our light
curves are essentially identical but a lot of it is slightly 
different. This is actually more because we have ever so slightly
different working environments on our computers rather than a
hatred of collaboration.

Thanks :)
